# Agent Guidelines

- This repository currently contains only documentation; keep new source files organized under directories
  such as `src/`, `public/`, or `content/`.
- When adding documentation files, use Markdown and keep line length under 100 characters when practical.
- There are no automated tests defined yet. If you add runnable code, document how to build and test it in the
  README.
